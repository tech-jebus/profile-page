# 🌐 Tech Jebus - Profile Page

This is my custom personal profile page, inspired by sites like [guns.lol](https://guns.lol) and [Linktree](https://linktr.ee), but fully self-hosted, fast, and lightweight. It's built with plain HTML and CSS — no JavaScript, no frameworks, just clean and simple. You can view my live profile page [here](https://techjebus.games).
